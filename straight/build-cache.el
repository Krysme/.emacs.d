MELPA-STYLE-RECIPE is either a symbol naming a package, or a list
whose car is a symbol naming a package and whose cdr is a
property list containing e.g. `:type', `:local-repo', `:files',
and VC backend specific keywords.

First, the package recipe is registered with straight.el. If
NO-CLONE is a function, then it is called with two arguments: the
package name as a string, and a boolean value indicating whether
the local repository for the package is available. In that case,
the return value of the function is used as the value of NO-CLONE
instead. In any case, if NO-CLONE is non-nil, then processing
stops here.

Otherwise, the repository is cloned, if it is missing. If
NO-BUILD is a function, then it is called with one argument: the
package name as a string. In that case, the return value of the
function is used as the value of NO-BUILD instead. In any case,
if NO-BUILD is non-nil, then processing halts here. Otherwise,
the package is built and activated. Note that if the package
recipe has a nil `:build' entry, then NO-BUILD is ignored
and processing always stops before building and activation
occurs.

CAUSE is a string explaining the reason why
`straight-use-package' has been called. It is for internal use
only, and is used to construct progress messages. INTERACTIVE is
non-nil if the function has been called interactively. It is for
internal use only, and is used to determine whether to show a
hint about how to install the package permanently.

:init            Code to run before PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.
:config          Code to run after PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.  Note that
                 if loading is deferred for any reason, this code does not
                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface         Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this
                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode            Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.
:magic           Form to be added to `magic-mode-alist'.
:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
                 package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily
                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:autoload        Similar to :commands, but it for no-interactive one.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:after           Delay the effect of the use-package declaration
                 until after the named libraries have loaded.
                 Before they have been loaded, no other keyword
                 has any effect at all, and once they have been
                 loaded it is as if `:after' was not specified.

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `Custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable

:custom-face     Call `custom-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as the
first character of the input string. The format is similar to Perl-style
regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/. Furthermore command line options can be
passed to grep, specified behind --. The overall prompt input has the form
`#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular expressions
to Posix regular expressions. Always enter Emacs regular expressions at the
prompt. `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs search commands, e.g.,
Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions. Furthermore the asynchronous
input split into words, each word must match separately and in any order. See
`consult--regexp-compiler' for the inner workings. In order to disable
transformations of the grep input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler'
accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)

These bindings may be added when `after-init-hook' is run.
Each binding is added if and only if at that time no other key
is bound to the same command and no other command is bound to
the same key.  In other words we try to avoid adding bindings
that are unnecessary, as well as bindings that conflict with
other bindings.

Adding the above bindings is delayed until `after-init-hook'
is called to allow users to set the variable anywhere in their
init file (without having to make sure to do so before `magit'
is loaded or autoloaded) and to increase the likelihood that
all the potentially conflicting user bindings have already
been added.

To set this variable use either `setq' or the Custom interface.
Do not use the function `customize-set-variable' because doing
that would cause Magit to be loaded immediately when that form
is evaluated (this differs from `custom-set-variables', which
doesn't load the libraries that define the customized variables).

Setting this variable to nil has no effect if that is done after
the key bindings have already been added.

We recommend that you bind \"C-c g\" instead of \"C-c M-g\" to
`magit-file-dispatch'.  The former is a much better binding
but the \"C-c <letter>\" namespace is strictly reserved for
users; preventing Magit from using it by default.

easy.  Complete documentation is available online at URL
`https://www.flycheck.org/en/latest/'.  Please report issues and

The following PROPERTIES constitute an error level:

`:severity SEVERITY'
     A number denoting the severity of this level.  The higher
     the number, the more severe is this level compared to other
     levels.  Defaults to 0; info is -10, warning is 10, and
     error is 100.

     The severity is used by `flycheck-error-level-<' to
     determine the ordering of errors according to their levels.

`:compilation-level LEVEL'

     A number indicating the broad class of messages that errors
     at this level belong to: one of 0 (info), 1 (warning), or
     2 or nil (error).  Defaults to nil.

     This is used by `flycheck-checker-pattern-to-error-regexp'
     to map error levels into `compilation-mode''s hierarchy and
     to get proper highlighting of errors in `compilation-mode'.

`:overlay-category CATEGORY'
     A symbol denoting the overlay category to use for error
     highlight overlays for this level.  See Info
     node `(elisp)Overlay Properties' for more information about
     overlay categories.

     A category for an error level overlay should at least define
     the `face' property, for error highlighting.  Another useful
     property for error level categories is `priority', to
     influence the stacking of multiple error level overlays.

`:fringe-bitmap BITMAPS'
     A fringe bitmap symbol denoting the bitmap to use for fringe
     indicators for this level, or a cons of two bitmaps (one for
     narrow fringes and one for wide fringes).  See Info node
     `(elisp)Fringe Bitmaps' for more information about fringe
     bitmaps, including a list of built-in fringe bitmaps.

`:fringe-face FACE'
     A face symbol denoting the face to use for fringe indicators
     for this level.

`:margin-spec SPEC'
     A display specification indicating what to display in the
     margin when `flycheck-indication-mode' is `left-margin' or
     `right-margin'.  See Info node `(elisp)Displaying in the
     Margins'.  If omitted, Flycheck generates an image spec from
     the fringe bitmap.

     level in the error list.  See `flycheck-list-errors'.

In addition to the properties understood by
`flycheck-define-generic-checker', the following PROPERTIES
constitute a command syntax checker.  Unless otherwise noted, all
properties are mandatory.  Note that the default `:error-filter'
of command checkers is `flycheck-sanitize-errors'.

`:command COMMAND'
     The command to run for syntax checking.

     COMMAND is a list of the form `(EXECUTABLE [ARG ...])'.

     EXECUTABLE is a string with the executable of this syntax
     checker.  It can be overridden with the variable
     `flycheck-SYMBOL-executable'.  Note that this variable is
     NOT implicitly defined by this function.  Use
     `flycheck-def-executable-var' to define this variable.

     Each ARG is an argument to the executable, either as string,
     or as special symbol or form for
     `flycheck-substitute-argument', which see.

`:error-patterns PATTERNS'
     A list of patterns to parse the output of the `:command'.

     Each ITEM in PATTERNS is a list `(LEVEL SEXP ...)', where
     LEVEL is a Flycheck error level (see
     `flycheck-define-error-level'), followed by one or more RX
     `SEXP's which parse an error of that level and extract line,
     column, file name and the message.

     See `rx' for general information about RX, and
     `flycheck-rx-to-string' for some special RX forms provided
     by Flycheck.

     All patterns are applied in the order of declaration to the
     whole output of the syntax checker.  Output already matched
     by a pattern will not be matched by subsequent patterns.  In
     other words, the first pattern wins.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, however, an
     `:error-parser' is mandatory.

`:error-parser FUNCTION'
     A function to parse errors with.

     The function shall accept three arguments OUTPUT CHECKER
     BUFFER.  OUTPUT is the syntax checker output as string,
     CHECKER the syntax checker that was used, and BUFFER a
     buffer object representing the checked buffer.  The function
     must return a list of `flycheck-error' objects parsed from
     OUTPUT.

     This property is optional.  If omitted, it defaults to
     `flycheck-parse-with-patterns'.  In this case,
     `:error-patterns' is mandatory.

`:standard-input t'
     Whether to send the buffer contents on standard input.

     If this property is given and has a non-nil value, send the
     contents of the buffer on standard input.

     Defaults to nil.

Note that you may not give `:start', `:interrupt', and
`:print-doc' for a command checker.  You can give a custom
`:verify' function, though, whose results will be appended to the
default `:verify' function of command checkers.

    (BODY-MAP BODY-KEY &rest BODY-PLIST)

DOCSTRING will be displayed in the echo area to identify the
Hydra.  When DOCSTRING starts with a newline, special Ruby-style
substitution will be performed by `hydra--format'.

Functions are created on basis of HEADS, each of which has the
format:

    (KEY CMD &optional HINT &rest PLIST)

BODY-MAP is a keymap; `global-map' is used quite often.  Each
function generated from HEADS will be bound in BODY-MAP to
BODY-KEY + KEY (both are strings passed to `kbd'), and will set
the transient map so that all following heads can be called
though KEY only.  BODY-KEY can be an empty string.

CMD is a callable expression: either an interactive function
name, or an interactive lambda, or a single sexp (it will be
wrapped in an interactive lambda).

HINT is a short string that identifies its head.  It will be
printed beside KEY in the echo erea if `hydra-is-helpful' is not
nil.  If you don't even want the KEY to be printed, set HINT
explicitly to nil.

The heads inherit their PLIST from BODY-PLIST and are allowed to
override some keys.  The keys recognized are :exit, :bind, and :column.
:exit can be:

- nil (default): this head will continue the Hydra state.
- t: this head will stop the Hydra state.

:bind can be:
- nil: this head will not be bound in BODY-MAP.
- a lambda taking KEY and CMD used to bind a head.

:column is a string that sets the column for all subsequent heads.

It is possible to omit both BODY-MAP and BODY-KEY if you don't
want to bind anything.  In that case, typically you will bind the
generated NAME/body command.  This command is also the return
result of `defhydra'.

 (1) POSITION

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx
   :parent-frame xxx
   :parent-window-left xxx
   :parent-window-top xxx
   :parent-frame-width xxx
   :parent-frame-height xxx
   :parent-window xxx
   :parent-window-width  xxx
   :parent-window-height xxx
   :mouse-x xxx
   ;mouse-y xxx
   :minibuffer-height xxx
   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-center'
6.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-left-corner'
7.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-bottom-right-corner'
8.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
10. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-left-corner'
14. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-right-corner'
15. `posframe-poshandler-point-top-left-corner'
16. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner'
17. `posframe-poshandler-point-bottom-left-corner-upward'
18. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
19. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (11) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (12) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (13) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (14) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (16) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (17) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (18) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other appliction
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

features, or its preference to work with multiple projects simultaneously.  When
enabled it will function as an automated version of
`treemacs-display-current-project-exclusively', making sure that, after a small
idle delay, the current project, and *only* the current project, is displayed in
treemacs.

The project detection is based on the current buffer, and will try to determine
the project using the following methods, in the order they are listed:

- the current projectile.el project, if `treemacs-projectile' is installed
- the current project.el project
- the current `default-directory'

The update will only happen when treemacs is in the foreground, meaning a
treemacs window must exist in the current scope.

`window-buffer-change-functions' and `window-selection-change-functions'.

This acts as more fine-grained alternative to `treemacs-follow-mode' and will
thus disable `treemacs-follow-mode' on activation.  When enabled treemacs will
focus not only the file of the current buffer, but also the tag at point.

The follow action is attached to Emacs' idle timer and will run
`treemacs-tag-follow-delay' seconds of idle time.  The delay value is not an
integer, meaning it accepts floating point values like 1.5.

Every time a tag is followed a re--scan of the imenu index is forced by
temporarily setting `imenu-auto-rescan' to t (though a cache is applied as long
as the buffer is unmodified).  This is necessary to assure that creation or
deletion of tags does not lead to errors and guarantees an always up-to-date tag
view.

Note that in order to move to a tag in treemacs the treemacs buffer's window
needs to be temporarily selected, which will reset blink-cursor-mode's timer if
it is enabled.  This will result in the cursor blinking seemingly pausing for a
short time and giving the appearance of the tag follow action lasting much
longer than it really does.

This mode provides (not just) basic editing capabilities for
working with Go code. It offers almost complete syntax
highlighting, indentation that is almost identical to gofmt and
proper parsing of the buffer content to allow features such as
navigation by function, manipulation of comments or detection of
strings.

In addition to these core features, it offers various features to
help with writing Go code. You can directly run buffer content
through gofmt, read godoc documentation from within Emacs, modify
and clean up the list of package imports or interact with the
Playground (uploading and downloading pastes).

The following extra functions are defined:

- `gofmt'
- `godoc' and `godoc-at-point'
- `go-import-add'
- `go-goto-arguments'
- `go-goto-docstring'
- `go-goto-function'
- `go-goto-function-name'
- `go-goto-imports'
- `go-goto-return-values'
- `go-goto-method-receiver'
- `go-play-buffer' and `go-play-region'
- `go-download-play'
- `godef-describe' and `godef-jump'
- `go-coverage'

If you want to automatically run `gofmt' before saving a file,
add the following hook to your Emacs configuration:

(add-hook 'before-save-hook #'gofmt-before-save)

If you want to use `godef-jump' instead of etags (or similar),
consider binding godef-jump to `M-.', which is the default key
for `find-tag':

(add-hook 'go-mode-hook (lambda ()
                          (local-set-key (kbd \"M-.\") #'godef-jump)))

Please note that godef is an external dependency. You can install
it with

go get github.com/rogpeppe/godef


If you're looking for even more integration with Go, namely
on-the-fly syntax checking, auto-completion and snippets, it is
recommended that you look at flycheck
(see URL `https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck') or flymake in combination
with goflymake (see URL `https://github.com/dougm/goflymake'), gocode

Racket Mode is implemented as an Emacs Lisp \"front end\" that

delivered as an Emacs package instead of a Racket package,
installing it does not do the `raco setup` that is normally done
for Racket packages.

This command will do a `raco make` of Racket Mode's .rkt files,
creating bytecode files in `compiled/` subdirectories. As a
result, when a command must start the Racket process, it will
start somewhat faster.

On many computers, the resulting speed up is negligible, and
might not be worth the complication.

If you run this command, ever, you will need to run it again
after:

- Installing an updated version of Racket Mode. Otherwise, you
  might lose some of the speed-up.

- Installing a new version of Racket and/or changing the value of
  the variable `racket-program'. Otherwise, you might get an

The main, intended use of Racket Mode's REPL is that you
`find-file' some specific .rkt file, then run it using
`racket-run' or `racket-run-module-at-point'. The resulting REPL
will correspond to those definitions and match your expectations.

If you really want to start a REPL for no file in particular,
then you could use this `racket-repl' command. But the resulting
REPL will have a minimal \"#lang racket/base\" namespace. You
could enter \"(require racket)\" if you want the equivalent of
\"#lang racket\". You could also \"(require racket/enter)\" if
you want things like \"enter!\". But in some sense you'd be

- \\[universal-argument] \\[racket-run-and-switch-to-repl]

  value like \"low\" or \"medium\", then conveniently re-run

- \\[universal-argument] \\[universal-argument] \\[racket-run-and-switch-to-repl]

  Instruments code for step debugging. See `racket-debug-mode'
  and the variable `racket-debuggable-files'.

Each run occurs within a Racket custodian. Any prior run's
custodian is shut down, releasing resources like threads and
ports. Each run's evaluation environment is reset to the contents
of the source file. In other words, like Dr Racket, this provides
the benefit that your source file is the \"single source of
truth\". At the same time, the run gives you a REPL inside the
namespace of the module, giving you the ability to explore it
interactively. Any explorations are temporary, unless you also
make them to your source file, they will be lost on the next run.

See also `racket-run-and-switch-to-repl', which is even more like
Dr Racket's Run command because it selects the REPL window after
running.

In the `racket-repl-mode' buffer, output that describes a file
and position is automatically \"linkified\". Examples of such
text include:

- Racket error messages.
- rackunit test failure location messages.
- print representation of path objects.

Behaves like the \"Automatically adjust opening square brackets\"
feature in Dr. Racket.

By default, inserts a `(`. Inserts a `[` in the following cases:

  - `let`-like bindings -- forms with `let` in the name as well
    as things like `parameterize`, `with-handlers`, and
    `with-syntax`.

  - `case`, `cond`, `match`, `syntax-case`, `syntax-parse`, and
    `syntax-rules` clauses.

  - `for`-like bindings and `for/fold` accumulators.

  - `class` declaration syntax, such as `init` and `inherit`.

When the previous s-expression in a sequence is a compound
expression, uses the same kind of delimiter.

To force insert `[`, use `quoted-insert'.

Combined with `racket-insert-closing' this means that you can
press the unshifted `[` and `]` keys to get whatever delimiters
follow the Racket conventions for these forms. When something
like `electric-pair-mode' or `paredit-mode' is active, you need
not even press `]`.

Tip: When also using `paredit-mode', enable that first so that
the binding for the `[`' key in the map for
`racket-smart-open-bracket-mode' has higher priority. See also
the variable `minor-mode-map-alist'.

The racket-unicode input method lets you easily type various
Unicode symbols that might be useful when writing Racket code.

To automatically enable the racket-unicode input method in
racket-mode and racket-repl-mode buffers, put the following code
in your Emacs init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (add-hook \\='racket-mode-hook #\\='racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
    (add-hook \\='racket-repl-mode-hook #\\='racket-unicode-input-method-enable)
#+END_SRC

To temporarily enable this input method for a single buffer you
can use \"M-x racket-unicode-input-method-enable\".

Use the standard Emacs key C-\\ to toggle the input method.

When the racket-unicode input method is active, you can for
example type \"All\" and it is immediately replaced with \"∀\". A
few other examples:

| omega     | ω                        |
| x_1       | x₁                       |
| x^1       | x¹                       |
| A         | 𝔸                        |
| test-->>E | test-->>∃ (racket/redex) |
| vdash     | ⊢                        |

To see a table of all key sequences use \"M-x
describe-input-method <RET> racket-unicode\".

If you want to add your own mappings to the \"racket-unicode\"
input method, you may add code like the following example in your
Emacs init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    ;; Either (require \\='racket-mode) here, or, if you use
    ;; use-package, put the code below in the :config section.
    (with-temp-buffer
      (racket-unicode-input-method-enable)

        (quail-define-rules ((append . t))
                            (\"^o\" [\"ᵒ\"]))))

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Racket-Xp mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive,
enable the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable
the mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.
Disable the mode if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `racket-xp-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when
it is disabled.

This minor mode is an optional enhancement to `racket-mode' edit
buffers. Like any minor mode, you can turn it on or off for a
specific buffer. If you always want to use it, put the following
code in your Emacs init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
    (require \\='racket-xp)
    (add-hook \\='racket-mode-hook #\\='racket-xp-mode)
#+END_SRC

Note: This mode won't do anything unless/until the Racket Mode
back end is running. It will try to start the back end
automatically. You do /not/ need to `racket-run' the buffer you
are editing.

This mode uses the drracket/check-syntax package to analyze
fully-expanded programs, without needing to evaluate a.k.a.
\"run\" them. The resulting analysis provides information for:

- Visually annotating bindings -- local or imported definitions
  and references to them.

- Visually annotating expressions in a tail position, as well as
  the enclosing expression with respect to which they are in a
  tail position.

- Completion candidates.

- Defintions' source and documentation.

When point is on a definition or use, related items are
highlighted using `racket-xp-def-face' and `racket-xp-use-face'
-- instead of drawing arrows as in Dr Racket. Information is
displayed using the function(s) in the hook variable
`racket-show-functions'; it is also available when hovering the
mouse cursor.

Note: If you find these point-motion features too distracting
and/or slow, in your `racket-xp-mode-hook' you may disable them:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
  (require \\='racket-xp)
  (add-hook \\='racket-xp-mode-hook
            (lambda ()
              (remove-hook \\='pre-redisplay-functions
                           #\\='racket-xp-pre-redisplay
                           t)))
#+END_SRC

The remaining features discussed below will still work.

You may also use commands to navigate among a definition and its
uses, or to rename a local definitions and all its uses:

  - `racket-xp-next-definition'
  - `racket-xp-previous-definition'
  - `racket-xp-next-use'
  - `racket-xp-previous-use'

In the following little example, not only does
drracket/check-syntax distinguish the various \"x\" bindings, it
understands the two different imports of \"define\":

#+BEGIN_SRC racket
  #lang racket/base
  (define x 1)
  x
  (let ([x x])
    (+ x 1))
  (module m typed/racket/base
    (define x 2)
    x)
#+END_SRC

When point is on the opening parenthesis of an expression in tail
position, it is highlighted using the face
`racket-xp-tail-position-face'.

When point is on the opening parenthesis of an enclosing
expression with respect to which one or more expressions are in
tail position, it is highlighted using the face
`racket-xp-tail-target-face'.

Furthermore, when point is on the opening parenthesis of either
kind of expression, all of the immediately related expressions
are also highlighted. Various commands move among them:

  - `racket-xp-tail-up'
  - `racket-xp-tail-down'
  - `racket-xp-tail-next-sibling'
  - `racket-xp-tail-previous-sibling'

The function `racket-xp-complete-at-point' is added to the
variable `completion-at-point-functions'. Note that in this case,
it is not smart about submodules; identifiers are assumed to be
definitions from the file's module or its imports. In addition to
supplying completion candidates, it supports the
\":company-location\" property to inspect the definition of a
candidate and the \":company-doc-buffer\" property to view its
documentation.

When you edit the buffer, existing annotations are retained;
their positions are updated to reflect the edit. Annotations for
new or deleted text are not requested until after
`racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay' seconds. The request is
made asynchronously so that Emacs will not block -- for
moderately complex source files, it can take some seconds simply
to fully expand them, as well as a little more time for the
drracket/check-syntax analysis. When the results are ready, all
annotations for the buffer are completely refreshed.

You may also set `racket-xp-after-change-refresh-delay' to nil
and use the `racket-xp-annotate' command manually.

The mode line changes to reflect the current status of
annotations, and whether or not you had a syntax error.

If you have one or more syntax errors, `racket-xp-next-error' and
`racket-xp-previous-error' navigate among them. Although most
languages will stop after the first syntax error, some like Typed
Racket will try to collect and report multiple errors.

You may use `xref-find-definitions' \\[xref-find-definitions],
`xref-pop-marker-stack' \\[xref-pop-marker-stack], and
`xref-find-references': `racket-xp-mode' adds a backend to the
variable `xref-backend-functions'. This backend uses information
from the drracket/check-syntax static analysis. Its ability to
find references is limited to the current file; when it finds
none it will try the default xref backend implementation which is
grep-based.

Tip: This mode follows the convention that a minor mode may only
use a prefix key consisting of \"C-c\" followed by a punctuation
key. As a result, `racket-xp-control-c-hash-keymap' is bound to
\"C-c #\" by default. Although you might find this awkward to
type, remember that as an Emacs user, you are free to bind this
map to a more convenient prefix, and/or bind any individual
commands directly to whatever keys you prefer.
